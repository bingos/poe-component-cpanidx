NAME
    POE::Component::CPANIDX - A POE mechanism for querying the CPANIDX

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
CONSTRUCTOR
    "spawn"
        Creates a new POE::Component::CPANIDX session.

        Takes one optional argument "alias" so you can set an alias on the
        component to send it events later.

        Returns an object reference which the following methods can be used
        on.

METHODS
    "session_id"
        Takes no arguments. Returns the POE::Session ID of the component.

    "shutdown"
        Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

    "query_idx"

        "event"
            The name of the "event" that should be sent to the requesting
            session with the reply from the CPANIDX server. This is
            required.

        See "OUTPUT EVENTS" below for what will be sent to your session in
        reply.

        You may also set arbitary keys to pass arbitary data along with your
        request. These must be prefixed with an underscore "_".

INPUT EVENTS
    These are POE events that the component will accept.

    "shutdown"
        Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

    "query_idx"

        "event"
            The name of the "event" that should be sent to the requesting
            session with the reply from the CPANIDX server. This is
            required.

        See "OUTPUT EVENTS" below for what will be sent to your session in
        reply.

        You may also set arbitary keys to pass arbitary data along with your
        request. These must be prefixed with an underscore "_".

OUTPUT EVENTS
    The component will send an event in response to "query_idx". "ARG0" of
    the event will be a "HASHREF" containing the key/values of the original
    request ( including any arbitary key/values passed ).
